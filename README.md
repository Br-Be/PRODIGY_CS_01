About Caesar Cipher :
It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places known as shift value.
This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used this cipher for secure communication.

Encryption Process:
Identify Shift: Choose a shift value x.
Example: x=3
Shift Letters: For each letter in the plaintext, shift it by 
x, x positions in the alphabet. If the shift goes past 'Z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.

Decryption Process:
Identify Shift: Use the same shift value x.
Shift Letters Back: For each letter in the ciphertext, shift it back by x number of positions.
